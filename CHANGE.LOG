11/10/17 - version 1.2.1
Added makefile.scl for use with Redhat/Scientific Linux devtools
Modified vsup.f and cteqpdflibfast.f to be more compatible with gfortran 6+


1/25/16 - version 1.2
Added ZTOPschanLHA.x and ZTOPtchanLHA.x which tie into the LHAPDF interface.
  The input files for LHA runs require the PDF name and set number in place
  of the old versions CTEQ set number.
  Ie.: 58 		! pdf set CTEQ 4,5,6    becomes
       CT14nlo   0 	! lhapdf_set number
Support files were created for LHA program: pftopdg.f, alphas2.f
LHAPDF must be linked in (edit the makefile appropriately).


7/24/08 - version 1.1
Improved efficiency of one angular integration.  Distribution in phi of
  small angles between t and j1 is larger by factor of 2 in LOW statistics
  test files.


1/27/05 - version 1.0
This version now fully generates all angular dependence.  Previously, the
  event was fixed to have 1 particle in the y direction, since the overall
  events are symmetric in phi.  This eliminated 1 integration variable.  All
  integration variables have been put back in to facilitate comparison with
  other codes.  This required minor changes in (most files):
    tmain.f, tevent_lo2.f, tevent_nlo2.f, tevent_nlo3.f,
    smain.f, sevent_lo2.f, sevent_nlo2.f, sevent_nlo3.f
README.TXT  updated reference.


11/12/04 - version 0.2
vsup.f  Changed formatting statement of output to WHERE.AMI to prevent crashes
  with Intel compiler v. 8.1.
makefile  Added flags for Intel compiler 8.1 to specify new Pentium 4
  optimizations.


8/26/04 - version 0.1
cteqpdflibfast.f added checks inside structm5 and structm6 that set pieces to
  0d0 if they are < 0d0.  This is to exactly match what is done on the base
  CTEQ5/6, but only arises if x ~ 0.99, so is not generally an issue.  Note
  that this means structm may be returning negative values for some pieces,
  e.g. d_v = -d_s, but d_v+d_s >= 0.  So unless different rounding schemes are
  used in different places, this should be OK.  This is not a bug.

  Consequences:
  Does not effect ZTOP at all, but allows more portability of cteqpdflibfast.f.
